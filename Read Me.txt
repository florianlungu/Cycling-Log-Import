I like to download all my GPS fit files and keep an Excel journal of metrics and feedback.


1. [Annual] Create an annual plan in Excel
	> Open Cycling Log 2020.xlsx
	> Update bike list in worksheet Charts A23-A26
	> Update starting values in worksheet Charts X2-X8
	> Copy values from worksheet Plan column B into Ride Log column C
	> Where needed, replace workouts in Ride Log column C with 3 day combo of Rest Day / Race Prep / Race

2. [Annual] Copy calendar from Excel to Google Sheet > Cycling Log 2020
	> Open Cycling Log 2020.xlsx
	> Copy Calendar Flat A2-E367 to Google Sheet > Ride Log
	> Copy Calendar A2-I107 to Google Sheet > Calendar
	> Update bike list in Data Choices

3. [Daily] Update Google Sheet > Ride Log > Columns Bike, Type, & Notes
	I use this file as a template to enter feedback after a workout. Its convient since its online.
	I'll create a new file for each year (Cycling Log 2020). At the end of each month, It's easy to copy and 
	paste the data from here into my local Excel file.

	> Copy Google Sheet > Ride Log > Columns Bike, Type, & Notes into Excel > Ride Log
	> I will hide a month on the Ride Log and Calendar sheets once its past
	> Open Golden Cheetah, click on Tools > Export Metrics as CSV 
	> Run Cycling Log Import.exe
